## Includes

### [React's official base eslint rules](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app#usage-outside-of-create-react-app)

### Prettier settings:

```js
{
	useTabs:  false,
	tabWidth:  2,
	printWidth:  80,
	singleQuote:  false,
	trailingComma:  "none",
	jsxBracketSameLine:  false,
	semi:  false
}
```

make sure you have the following setting enabled in VSCode:

```js
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
},
```

since prettier is already included here, you don't need to run any prettifying tools on your end, eslint already does that for you, you're welcome!
